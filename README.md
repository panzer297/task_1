Cleaned netflix dataset using excel
I cleaned the Netflix dataset using Excel by performing the following steps:
. Filled missing values in columns like director, cast, and country with "Unknown", and rating with "NR". Rows with missing date_added were removed.
. Removed all duplicate rows to avoid redundancy.
. Standardized text values â€” converted columns like type, country, and rating to lowercase and removed extra spaces.
. Formatted the date_added column to a consistent dd-mm-yyyy format.
. Renamed all column headers to lowercase and replaced spaces with underscores to maintain uniformity.
. Checked data types and ensured columns like release_year are integers and date_added is in proper date format.
. The dataset is now clean, consistent, and ready for analysis.
